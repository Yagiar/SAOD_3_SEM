Codification (law)
In law, codification is the process of collecting and restating the law of a jurisdiction. They are listed, usually by subject, forming a legal code (a codex or book of law). Codification is the defining feature of civil law jurisdictions. ==History== Ancient Sumer's Code of Ur-Nammu was compiled 2100-2050 BC. It is the earliest known surviving civil code. Three centuries later, the Babylonian king Hammurabi enacted the set of laws named after him. Religious laws such as the Torah were codified. Important codifications were developed in the ancient Roman Empire, with the compilations of the Lex Duodecim Tabularum. Much later the Corpus Iuris Civilis was assembled. These codified laws were the exceptions rather than the rule. During much of ancient history the Roman laws were left mostly uncodified. The first permanent system of codified laws could be found in China. This was with the compilation of the Tang Code in AD 624. This formed the basis of the Chinese criminal code. This was then replaced by the Great Qing Legal Code. This code was in turn abolished in 1912 following the Xinhai Revolution and the establishment of the Republic of China. The new laws of the Republic of China were inspired by the German codified work, the Burgerliches Gesetzbuch.Chinese law A very influential example in Europe was the French Napoleonic code of 1804. Another early system of laws is Hindu law framed by Manu and called as Manu Smriti. They date back to the 2nd century BC. The use of civil codes in Islamic Sharia law began with the Ottoman Empire in the 16th century AD. ==References== Category:Legal terms Category:International law

Cosmological principle
In modern physical cosmology, the cosmological principle is a prediction based on the idea that the universe is about the same in all places when viewed on a large scale. Forces are expected to act uniformly throughout the universe. There should, therefore, be no observable irregularities in the large scale structure. The structure is the result of the evolution of the matter field after the Big Bang. Astronomer William Keel explains: > The cosmological principle is usually stated formally as 'Viewed on a > sufficiently large scale, the properties of the universe are the same for > all observers.' This amounts to the strongly philosophical statement that > the part of the universe which we can see is a fair sample, and that the > same physical laws apply throughout.. p. 2. The two testable consequences of the cosmological principle are homogeneity and isotropy. Homogeneity means that the same observational evidence is available to observers at different locations in the universe ("the part of the universe which we can see is a fair sample"). Isotropy means that the same observational evidence is available by looking in any direction in the universe ("the same physical laws apply throughout"). The principles are closely related, because a universe that appears isotropic from any two (for a spherical geometry, three) locations must also be homogeneous. == References == Category:Cosmology

Elastin
thumb|Elastin derived from cow aorta Elastin is part of connective tissue. It is an elastic protein which allows many tissues in the body to go back to their shape after stretching or contracting. Elastin helps skin return to its original position when handled. Elastin is also used in places where mechanical energy is stored. Elastin is important in blood vessels because it helps blood to flow. It is common in large elastic blood vessels such as the aorta. Elastin is also very important in the lungs, ligaments, the skin, the bladder, and elastic cartilage. It is present in all vertebrates above the jawless fish. In humans, elastin is encoded by the ELN gene. == References == Category:Animal tissues

Afar Triangle
thumb|330px|right|Topographic map showing the Afar Triangle, which correlates to the shaded area in the location map shown above The Afar Triangle (or Afar Depression) is a low area bordering on the Red Sea. It is part of the Great Rift Valley in East Africa. The area overlaps the borders of Eritrea, Djibouti and the entire Afar region of Ethiopia. == Human fossils == Important fossil specimens of the earliest hominins have been found in this area. These are the earliest of the human clade. The area is thought by some paleontologists to be the cradle of the evolution of humans. Many important fossil localities exist in the Afar region. These sites have produced specimens of the earliest (fossil) hominins and of human tool culture, as well as many fossils of flora and fauna. == Geography == The Triangle includes the lowest point in Africa, Lake Asal, Djibouti, at 155 m (or 509 ft) below sea level. The Awash River is the main waterflow into the region. It runs dry during the annual dry season, and ends as a chain of saline lakes. The northern part of the Afar Depression is also known as the Danakil Depression. The lowlands are affected by heat, drought, and poor air circulation. Some of the lowlands are the hottest places (year-round average temperatures) of anywhere on Earth. The Afar Triangle is bordered by high areas, as shown on the topographic map. === Plate tectonics === The Depression is a plate tectonic triple junction. This geologic feature is one of earth's great active volcanic areas, so the floor of the depression is composed of lava, mostly basalt. The continuous process of volcanism makes mineral deposits, like sulfur, salt, bentonite, and gypsum. There are also geothermal energy sources and hot springs in different areas of the region. In 2005, a giant rift was formed in just a few days.Giant Crack In Africa, New Scientist, November 4, 2009 The rift opened when the Dabbahu Volcano erupted. The rift is part of the process of the Arabian and African plates moving apart. This new crack, long, and deep, opened when the lava from the erupting volcano flowed underground and cooled. It left a long, wide dike within days. == References == Category:East Africa Category:Archaeological sites in Africa
Chain mail
thumb|right|228px| Mail, or chain mail,"chain mail" Cambridge dictionaries online is a type of armour. It is made of small metal rings linked together in a pattern to form a mesh. The Celts are usually credited with inventing mail armour.Hazel Richardson, Life of the Ancient Celts (New York: Crabtree Publishing Co., 2005), p. 28 Celtic mail was usually made in the form of a vest. ==Etymology== The origins* of the word "mail" are not fully known. One theory is that it originally comes from the Latin word macula, meaning "spot" or "opacity"."mail, n.3". OED Online. December 2011. Oxford University Press. Another theory relates the word to the Old French "maillier", meaning "to hammer" (related to the modern English word "malleable"). A mail shirt is a called a hauberk (haubergeon or byrnie). Mail leggings were called chausses. A mail Hood is called a coif and covered the head, neck and shoulders. *Another possible source is Italian. The word for jersey or sweater, and sometimes shirt, in modern Italian is maglia or, in French, maillot. == History == Many scholars think mail was invented by ancient Celts about the 3rd century BC.Richard A. Gabriel, The Great Armies of Antiquity (Westport, CT: Praeger, 2002), p. 21 At that time their iron work was probably the best in Europe.Richard A. Gabriel, The Ancient World (Westport, CT: Greenwood Press, 2006), p. 79 The Romans quickly adopted it for their own army. A shirt of mail armour weighed about . After a battle it was common practice to strip weapons and armour from the dead.Encyclopedia of Military Science, ed. G. Kurt Piehler (Thousand Oaks, CA: SAGE Publications, Inc., 2013). p. 270 Vikings were known to wear mail armor whenever they could get their hands on it. Mail was expensive, time-consuming to make, and required a supply of iron. It became more expensive as improvements were made in materials and workmanship.Ballistic Materials and Penetration Mechanics, ed. Roy Laible (Amsterdam; New York: Elsevier Scientific Pub. Co., 1980), p. 16 Mail armour was in use in Europe until the 15th century.Michele Byam, Arms and Armor (New York, NY: DK Publishers, 2011), p. 24 == Modern uses == Mail is today used in gloves to prevent cuts by butchers and firefighters.Gavriel Salvendy, Handbook of Human Factors and Ergonomics (Hoboken, NJ: Wiley, 2012), p. 904 Some divers wear mail suits when swimming around sharks and particularly when feeding sharks.Catherine Veitch, A Daredevil's Guide to Swimming with Sharks (North Mankato, MN: Capstone Press, 2013), p. 25 But mail is heavy and it makes moving around more difficult. Mail is very popular with history reenactors.Michael A. Cramer, Medieval Fantasy as Performance: The Society for Creative Anachronism and the Current Middle Ages (Lanham, MD: Scarecrow Press, 2010). p. 123 It is also popular in live action role playing.Lizzie Stark, Leaving Mundania: Inside the Transformative World of Live Action Role-Playing Games (Chicago: Chicago Review Press, 2012), p. 113 == Gallery == File:Verschiedene Kettenhemden.jpg|.

Triatominae
The members of Triatominae are a subfamily of Reduviidae. They are also called kissing bugs, conenose bugs, assassin bugs or triatomines. There are more than 130 species in this subfamily. Most of them feed on vertebrate blood. A few species feed on other invertebrates. They are mainly found in the Americas. There are a few species in Asia, Australia and Africa. Some of the bugs carry the Chagas disease parasite Trypanosoma cruzi. However, only those species (such as Triatoma infestans and Rhodnius prolixus) well adapted to living with humans are considered important vectors. ==References== Category:Hemiptera

Balawaristan National Front (Naji)
thumb|300px|Flag of the Balawaristan National Front. The party was formed on December 28, 1989 under the Chairmanship of Nawaz Khan Naji. The first time reorganized in July 30 1993. In 1947 at the time of Independence of Pakistan the people of the area were predominantly Shia Muslims. However over the years the ethnic composition has been changed as sunni Kashmiri and other Pakistanis have settled in this area leading to discontent - although Shias remain the outright majority. A 2008 report by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees determined that Pakistan-administered Kashmir, which included Gilgit- Baltistan, was 'Not Free'. In 2009 as part of Gilgit-Baltistan Empowerment and Self-Governance Order Act of 2009, the region was granted self-rule for the first time with an elected legislature in its history, despite protests from the Republic of India it asserts that Gilgit-Baltistan is a part of the former Princely state of Kashmir and Jammu which they regard it as so-called an 'integral part' of India.Gilgit-Baltistan is part of Kashmir, asserts India which illegally regards the disputed region as Indian territory. ==References== B
